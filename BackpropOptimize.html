      <h1 id = "intro">Backpropagation and Optimization</h1>
      <p>Some neural networks are now able to do some tasks even</p>
      <p>better than humans can ex. playing chess, predicting weather.</p>
      <p>Neural networks need to learn how to solve problems by making mistakes.</p>
      <p>They handle mistakes by using an algorithm <b>backpropagation</b>.</p>
      <p><u>Backpropagation</u>: Making sure that all the neurons that contributed to an error get their math adjusted</p>
      <p>Two main parts of neural networks:</p>
      <p><b>● Architecture</b>: Neurons and their connections</p>
      <p><b>● Weights</b>: Numbers that fine tune how the neurons compute an output</p>
      <p>If a mistake is made, that often means that the weights are not adjusted</p>
      <p>correctly --> they need to be updated to make better predictions next time.</p>
      <p><b><u>Optimization:</b></u> The task of finding the best weights for a neural network architecture</.p>
      <p><b>Linear regression</b> is used by computers to find the <b>line of best fit</b> used to make predictions.</p>
      <img src = "LinearRegression.png" alt= "Linear Regression" width = "400" height = "243">
      <p>Weights are set to random numbers at first and adjusted accordingly.</p>
      <p>The sum of the distances between the line and each of the data points is called the <b>error</b>.</p>
      <p>As more features are added, more dimensions are added to the graph, and it gets harder to visualize.</p>
      <p>NEURAL NETWORKS!!!</p>
      <p>By connecting together many simple neurons with weights, a neural network can learn</p>
      <p>to solve complicated problems --> the line of best fit becomes a multidimensional function</p>
      <img src = "NeuralNetworkExample.png" alt= "Neural Network Example" width = "300" height = "200">
      <p>In some neural networks, the output layer may have a lot of neurons.</p>
      <p>the difference between the actual and predicted answer is then called the <b>loss function</b> (it’s more than one number)</p>
      <p><u>Backpropagation</u>: Look at the loss function --> assign blame to neurons in previous layers of network</p>
      <p>More blame => More weight adjustment</p>
