      <h1 id = "intro">Neural Networks</h1>
      <p>A lot can be done with AI by connecting a lot of perceptrons</p>
      <p>together to create an <b>artificial neural network</b>.</p>
      <p>Neural networks use what are called hidden layers.</p>
      <img src = "hiddenlayers.png" alt= "Hidden Layers" width = "400" height = "243">
      <p>The neurons in the hidden layers perform functions and output</p>
      <p>numbers that are then taken in by the consecutive layers.</p>
      <p>Each neuron is looking for some specific component of the input data.</p>
      <p>Neural networks can be used in various applications, such as image and sound recognition</p>
      <p>The different features are able to be represented by numbers</p>
      <p>Ex: the colors of the pixels are represented by the amount of red, blue, green in them</p>
      <img src = "hiddenlayers2.png" alt= "Hidden Layers 2" width = "600" height = "225">
      <p>In the end, the neural networks will output a value. In the case of image</p>
      <p>recognition, the probability that the image is a certain object</p>
      <p>Another aspect within neural networks is <b>deep learning</b>, which you may have heard of.</p>
      <p>In deep learning, there are just "deeper" neural networks, with more hidden layers</p>
      <img src = "deeplearning.png" alt = "Deep Learning" width = "400" height = "300">
      <p>There are more complex components, which can solve tricker problems.</p>
      <p>However, for this, you need faster computers for more math to be done.</p>
      <p>It's also harder to make sense of why its giving us the answers that it gives us.</p>
      <p>Neural newtorks are being used to make more and more decisions about our lives.</p>
